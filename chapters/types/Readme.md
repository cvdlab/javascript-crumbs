# Types

## Variables

JavaScript variables are **loosely typed**:  
a variable is simply a named placeholder for a value of any type.

#### definition

To define a variable, use the `var` operator followed by the variable name.

```js
var variable_name;
```

#### initialization

Without initialization, a variable holds the special value `undefined`.  

> #### note
> It’s possible to define the variable and set its value at the same time.
>
> ```js
> var message = 'hello!';
> ```
>
> #### note
> It's possible to change the value stored in the variable and also its type.
>
> ```js
> var response = 'bye!';
> response = 100;        //legal, but not recommended
> ```

## Data types

There are five simple data types (or primitive types):

* Null  
* Undefined  
* Boolean  
* Number  
* String  

and one complex data type:

* Object

All values can be represented as one of these six data types.  

## Null

`null` is a special value that all variables are considered to have  
if they have been defined but have not been assigned a value. 

`null` is a reserved word and cannot be used for anything,  
but to check that a variable does not have an assigned value.

## Undefined

Javascript treats `undefined` as being equal to `null`.  

The one difference between `null` and `undefined` is that  
`null` is a reserved word while `undefined` is not. 

> #### Note
> Since `undefined` is not a reserved word you can declare your own variable or function called undefined.
> 
> ```js
> var undefined = 'hello'; // legal, but not reccomended
> ```

## Booleans

Boolean data type has only two values: `true` and `false`, used without quotes.

```js
var t = true;
var f = false;
```

## Numbers

### Integer

The simplest number is an integer.

```js
var int1 = 1;
var int2 = 2;
var int3 = 3;
// ...
```

Integers can also be represented as either octal (base 8) or hexadecimal (base 16) literals.  

> #### Note
> octal or hexadecimal numbers are treated as decimal numbers in all arithmetic operations.

#### Octal numbers
starts with digit zero `0` followed by a sequence of octal digits (`0` through `7`).  

> #### Note
> If a number out of this range is detected in the literal,  
> then the leading zero is ignored and the number is treated as a decimal.
> 
> ```js
> var octal1 = 070; //octal for 56
> var octal2 = 079; //invalid octal - interpreted as 79
> var octal3 = 008; //invalid octal - interpreted as 8
> ```

#### Hexadecimal numbers
starts with two characters `0x` followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits (`0` through `9`, `A` through `F`).  

> #### Note
> Letters may be in uppercase or lowercase.
> 
> ```js
> var hexNum1 = 0x0;  //hexadecimal for 0
> var hexNum2 = 0xA;  //hexadecimal for 10
> var hexNum3 = 0X1F; //hexedecimal for 31
> ```

### Floating-Point Values

Floating-point value must include a decimal point `.` and at least one number after the decimal point.

```js
var float1 = 0.1;
var float2 = 1.2;
var float3 = 3.14;
```

> #### Convention
> Although an integer is not necessary before a decimal point, it is recommended.
>
> ```js
> var float4 = .1;  //valid, but not recommended
> ```

> #### Note
> Because storing floating-point values uses twice as much memory as storing integer values,
> JavaScript converts floating-point values into integers when it is possible:
> if there is no digit after the decimal point;
> if the number being represented is a whole number (decimal digit is 0).
> 
> ```js
> var float5 = 1.;   //missing digit after decimal - interpreted as integer 1
> var float6 = 10.0; //whole number - interpreted as integer 10
> ```

#### e-notation

For very large or very small numbers, floating-point values can be represented using e-notation.  
E-notation is used to indicate a number that should be multiplied by 10 raised to a given power.  
E-notation format starts with a number (integer or floating-point)  
followed by letter `e` (case-insensitive), followed by the power of 10 to multiply by.

> #### Example
> ```js
> 1e1;    //10
> 1e+1;   //10
> 2e+3;   //2000
> 2e-3;   //0.002
> 123E-3; //0.123
> ```

### Range of Values

JavaScript can not represent all numbers in the world, because of memory constraints:  
the smallest number is `5e-324`, stored in `Number.MIN_VALUE`;  
the largest number is `1.7976931348623157e+308`, stored in `Number.MAX_VALUE`.

#### Infinity

JavaScript use the special numeric value `Infinity` to represents a number out of the range of values:  
any positive number that can’t be represented is `Infinity` (positive infinity), stored in `Number.POSITIVE_INIFINITY`;  
any negative number that can’t be represented is `–Infinity` (negative infinity), stored in `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.

> #### Note
> `Infinity` represents a number.
>
> ```js
> typeof Infinity; //"number"
> ```

> #### Note 
> If a calculation returns either positive or negative Infinity,  
> that value cannot be used in any further calculations,  
> because Infinity has no numeric representation with which to calculate.
> 
> ```js
> Infinity - 1e307;    //Infinity 
> Infinity - Infinity; //NaN
> -Infinity * -1;      //Infinity
> Infinity * -1;       //-Infinity
> ```

#### Testing if a value is not out of range

To determine if a value is finite there is the `isFinite()` function.

> #### Example
> ```js
> isFinite(Infinity); //false
> isFinite(-Infinity); //false
> isFinite(Number.MAX_VALUE + Number.MAX_VALUE); //false
> isFinite(Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY); //false
> isFinite(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY); //false
> isFinite(0); //true
> isFinite(1.7e308); //true
> isFinite(1.8e308); //false
> ```

> #### Tip
> Though it is rare to do calculations that take values outside of the range of finite numbers,  
> it is possible and should be monitored when doing very large or very small calculations.

### NaN

JavaScript use the special numeric value `NaN`, short for Not a Number,  
to indicate when an operation intended to return a number has failed (as opposed to throwing an error).

The value `NaN` has a couple of unique properties:

* `NaN` is contagious, any operation involving `NaN` always returns `NaN`
* `NaN` is not equal to any value, including `NaN`

```js
Nan + 1 * 2 / 3; //NaN
NaN == NaN; //false
```

#### Testing if a value is not a number

To determine if a value is "not a number" there is the `isNaN()` function.  
`isNaN()` try to convert value passed in it into a number:  
if the value cannot be converted into a number the function returns `true`.

```js
isNaN(NaN); //true
isNaN(10); //false - 10 is a number
isNaN("10"); //false - can be converted to number 10
isNaN("blue"); //true - cannot be converted to a number
isNaN(true); //false - can be converted to number 1
```

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.  
In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of character placed between single or double quotes.

```js
"some characters";
'some characters and numbers 123 5.87';
'1';
"";
"'hello'";
'"hello"';
'hello"; //syntax error - quotes must match
```

#### Character Literals

Character literals represents nonprintable or otherwise useful characters:

* `\n` new line
* `\t` tab
* `\b` backspace
* `\r` carriage return
* `\f` form feed
* `\\` backslash (`\`)
* `\'` single quote (`'`) — used when the string is delineated by single quotes.
* `\"` double quote (`"`) — used when the string is delineated by double quotes.
* \xnn a character represented by hexadecimal code nn (where n is a hexadecimal digit 0-F).
* \unnnn a unicode character represented by the hexadecimal code nnnn (where n is a hexadecimal digit 0-F).

> #### Example
> 
> ```js
> 'he said \'hello\''; //"he said 'hello'"
> "he said \"hello\""; //"he said "hello""
> '\u03a3';            //"Σ"
> '\x41';              //"A"
> ```

## Object

An object is an unordered collection of key/value pairs,  
separated by commas `,`, placed within curly braces `{` and `}`.

The keys are strings, the values can be of any type (even Object).

```js
{
  s: 'string value',
  n: 123,
  b: true,
  o: {
    k: 2
  }
}
```

> #### Note
> 
> The keys can optionally be placed in quotation marks.  
> 
> ```js
> var obj = {
>   "s": 'string value',
>   'key': 'another value'
> };
>
